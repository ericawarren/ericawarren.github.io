					<p>
						As the population grows, we would expect arts funding to grow as well. Coincidentally, there appears to be a linear relationship from 1970 to 1991 or even 2001. However there is a sharp decline in state arts appropriations that begins in 2002 and bottoms out in 2012 leaving arts appropriations at the level we might expect in the 1990s.
